            <h1>Terms + Conditions of Sale</h1>
          </div>

          <p class="linitation-of-liability">
            These terms and conditions of sale (“Terms and Conditions”) are
            applicable to any order placed by any purchaser of products (herein
            referred to as “Buyer”) with and accepted by Brook and Whittle
            Limited (referred to herein as “Seller”):
          </p>

          <h2>1. AGREEMENT:</h2>
          <p>
            Seller, upon acceptance of an order placed by Buyer, will supply the
            products specified in the order to Buyer, pursuant to these Terms
            and Conditions. Seller’s acceptance of such order is expressly
            limited to the terms and conditions of any written agreement
            executed by Seller and Buyer and these Terms and Conditions. Terms
            additional to or different from these terms and conditions,
            including but not limited to terms contained in Buyer’s purchase
            order or Buyer’s standard terms and conditions of purchase, are
            deemed material and hereby rejected unless otherwise accepted by
            Seller in writing. Orders regularly placed, verbal or written,
            cannot be canceled except upon terms that will compensate Seller
            against all costs, expenses and losses incurred by Seller in
            reliance of the order. Order cancellations must be in writing.
          </p>

          <h2>2. QUOTATION:</h2>
          <p>
            A quotation not accepted within thirty (30) days is subject to
            review. Estimates are based upon the anticipated hours of work and
            cost of materials and supplies necessary to produce work in
            accordance with preliminary copy, style and specifications. The
            quoted price is exclusive of the following: (i) freight charges
            unless state otherwise in writing and; (ii) any sales, excise or
            other taxes of any nature whatsoever imposed by any government
            authority.
          </p>

          <h2>3. SHIPPING TERMS:</h2>
          <p>
            All products will be shipped F.O.B. Seller’s facility. Risk of loss
            and/or damage and title to the products will transfer to the Buyer
            on delivery to the carrier.
          </p>

          <h2>4. FREIGHT:</h2>
          <p>
            Unless a carrier has been specified on the Buyer’s purchase order,
            Seller will select a carrier for Buyer, with the express
            understanding that the carrier is not an agent of Seller. Orders may
            be shipped in one (1) or more installment(s), which the Buyer agrees
            to accept and be invoiced for, unless Buyer has provided Seller with
            prior, written notification that partial shipments will not be
            accepted. All products will be packed by Seller in accordance with
            standard commercial practices. Unless otherwise specified, the price
            quoted is for a single shipment, without storage, F.O.B. Seller’s
            facility. Charges related to delivery from Buyer to Seller, or from
            Buyer’s supplier to Seller, are not included in any quotations
            unless specified. Special priority pickup (including air freight) or
            delivery service will be provided at current rates upon Buyer’s
            request and at Buyer’s expense.
          </p>

          <h2>5. PAYMENT TERMS:</h2>
          <p>
            If credit worthiness has been approved in advance, Seller will grant
            payment terms of net thirty (30) days. It is then required that the
            full invoice be paid no later than thirty (30) days from the date of
            the invoice. All Seller invoices are issued upon shipment of the
            product.
          </p>

          <h2>6. OVER-RUNS AND UNDER-RUNS:</h2>
          <p>
            Over-runs and under-runs not to exceed 10% on quantities ordered, or
            any other percentage that Seller agrees to in writing, shall
            constitute acceptable delivery.Seller will bill for actual quantity
            delivered within this tolerance. If Buyer requires guaranteed
            minimum quantities, the percentage of over-run tolerance must be
            doubled, or additional costs may be charged.
          </p>

          <h2>7. SCHEDULING AND DELAYS:</h2>
          <p>
            Any time quoted by Seller for delivery is an estimate only. Seller
            is not liable for or in respect of any loss or damage arising from
            any delay in filling any order, failure to deliver or delay in
            delivery. However, if Seller delays shipment of all or any products
            for more than five (5) business days after the estimated delivery
            date (the “Delayed Shipment Date”), then Buyer may, as its sole
            remedy therefor, cancel the related purchase order with respect to
            the delayed products by giving Seller notice within two (2) business
            days prior to the Delayed Shipment Date. No delay in the shipment or
            delivery of any products relieves Buyer of its obligations under
            these Terms and Conditions or any written Agreement between Seller
            and Buyer, including without limitation accepting delivery of any
            remaining installment(s) of products.
          </p>

          <h2>8. LATE PAYMENTS; INVOICE DISPUTES:</h2>
          <p>
            Except for invoiced payments that Buyer has successfully disputed,
            Buyer shall pay interest on all late payments calculated daily and
            compounded monthly at the lesser of the rate of six percent (6%) or
            the highest rate permissible under applicable law. Buyer shall also
            reimburse Seller for all reasonable costs incurred by Seller in
            collecting any late payments, including attorney’s fees. Buyer shall
            notify Seller in writing of any dispute with any invoice (along with
            a reasonably detailed description of the dispute) within five (5)
            business days from Buyer’s receipt of such invoice. Buyer will be
            deemed to have accepted all invoices for which Seller does not
            receive timely notification of disputes and shall pay allundisputed
            amounts due under such invoices when due. The Parties shall seek to
            resolve any such disputes expeditiously and in good faith.
            Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall
            continue performing its obligations to Seller during any such
            dispute, including, without limitation, Buyer’s obligation to pay
            all due and undisputed invoice amounts.
          </p>

            purchase price paid by the Buyer. In no event shall Seller be liable
            for incidental, special or consequential damages, including profits

            order, then any work already in progress will be delivered and
            invoiced in accordance with the earlier instruction of the Buyer.

            with these terms and conditions.
