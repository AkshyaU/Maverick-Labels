                  We can produce great results from jpg/jpeg files, particularly
                  for photographic images to be printed on labels. You must use
                  the Excellent/Maximum quality setting in your photo editing
                  software and the image must be at least 300 dpi at the size
                  you want it printed on your labels. We do not recommend
                  jpg/jpeg files for label designs that include type or graphics
                  layered over a solid background.

                  Artwork can vary by printing method. Generally, we can accept
                  most types of professional graphics files. Best results will
                  be achieved from vector type files, also known as "draw"
                  files. These are produced by programs like Adobe® Illustrator®
                  (our preferred format), Corel Draw®, and Macromedia Freehand®
                  -- programs which generate "objects" or mathematically defined
                  shapes which can be filled and/or stroked with a specific spot
                  color. AutoCad®, or other CAD/CAM programs which can produce
                  files of type DXF or DWG can also be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Page layout programs combine pieces like vector files and
                  rasterized images into one layout. We can generally work with
                  Adobe® In-Design®, Adobe® PageMaker®, or Quark XPress®, and
                  Microsoft® Publisher®.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For certain jobs, we can also accept rasterized, or "paint"
                  type files. These are produced by programs such as Adobe®
                  Photoshop®, Corel Paint®, Painter®, etc. Paint files are known
                  as bitmapped files (actually a misnomer), because each pixel
                  of the image is mapped with a specific shade of color.
                  Rasterized images (like ones that come from a scanner), do not
                  translate as well to label production as do vector files,
                  particularly if they have to be "scaled" (adjusted in size).
                  Single color raster images will work best, and should be at
                  least 600 dpi resolution. That is, if you have a 3" x 4"
                  label, your raster file should be 1800 pixels by 2400 pixels.

                  For custom artwork (artwork that you provide to us), we
                  provide easy to use upload tools in our quoters and/or at
                  checkout. While uploading label artwork is the easiest and
                  fastest way to get artwork to us, you can email or mail/ship
                  your artwork as well. If you do not upload your artwork, your
                  order will be held until your artwork is received. This means
                  that your turnaround time will begin when we receive your
                  artwork, not when you place your order. To have your
                  turnaround time begin when you pay for your order, use the
                  upload feature at checkout.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some products can be designed online. In this case, the only
                  artwork you will probably need is your logo which can be
                  uploaded for use and placement in our design online tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The artwork for some products (asset tags and parking permits)
                  can be provided via fax. See asset tags and parking permits
                  pages for complete details.

                  We offer 3 convenient ways during the checkout process to
                  upload your artwork if required. Artwork only needs to be
                  uploaded once, so choose the most convenient option for you.
                  Once your artwork has been received, you will see your
                  filename displayed throughout the checkout process.

                <p>
                  • The first opportunity is on the "Additional Details" page,
                  after the job is added to the shopping cart.<br />
                  • On the payment page of checkout is the next upload
                  opportunity.<br />
                  • The last option is on the Order Confirmation page once the
                  order has been paid for.

                  If you do not have your artwork ready, go ahead and place your

                  receive a receipt via email which contains a link that will
                  allow you to upload artwork. Just remember, the production
                  schedule begins once we have received print-ready artwork.

                  DPI is an acronym for Dots Per Inch. DPI is a measurement of
                  the scanning resolution of an image or the quality of an
                  output device. DPI expresses the number of dots a printer can
                  print per inch or that a monitor can display both horizontally
                  and vertically. For instance, a lot of images you see on your
                  monitor are 72 dpi. While they look great on your computer
                  screen, they are not satisfactory for printing your job. Best
                  label printing results require artwork set to a minimum of 300
                  dpi at the size the artwork will be printed onto the labels.

                  We can produce great results from jpg/jpeg files, particularly

                  Artwork can vary by printing method. Generally, we can accept
                  most types of professional graphics files. Best results will
                  be achieved from vector type files, also known as "draw"
                  files. These are produced by programs like Adobe® Illustrator®
                  (our preferred format), Corel Draw®, and Macromedia Freehand®
                  -- programs which generate "objects" or mathematically defined
                  shapes which can be filled and/or stroked with a specific spot
                  color. AutoCad®, or other CAD/CAM programs which can produce
                  files of type DXF or DWG can also be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Page layout programs combine pieces like vector files and
                  rasterized images into one layout. We can generally work with
                  Adobe® In-Design®, Adobe® PageMaker®, or Quark XPress®, and
                  Microsoft® Publisher®.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For certain jobs, we can also accept rasterized, or "paint"
                  type files. These are produced by programs such as Adobe®
                  Photoshop®, Corel Paint®, Painter®, etc. Paint files are known
                  as bitmapped files (actually a misnomer), because each pixel
                  of the image is mapped with a specific shade of color.
                  Rasterized images (like ones that come from a scanner), do not
                  translate as well to label production as do vector files,
                  particularly if they have to be "scaled" (adjusted in size).
                  Single color raster images will work best, and should be at
                  least 600 dpi resolution. That is, if you have a 3" x 4"
                  label, your raster file should be 1800 pixels by 2400 pixels.

                  fastest way to get artwork to us, you can email or mail/ship
                  your artwork as well. If you do not upload your artwork, your
                  order will be held until your artwork is received. This means
                  that your turnaround time will begin when we receive your
                  artwork, not when you place your order. To have your
                  turnaround time begin when you pay for your order, use the
                  upload feature at checkout.

                  uploaded once, so choose the most convenient option for you.
                  Once your artwork has been received, you will see your

                  • On the payment page of checkout is the next upload
                  opportunity.<br />
                  • The last option is on the Order Confirmation page once the

                  receive a receipt via email which contains a link that will
                  allow you to upload artwork. Just remember, the production
                  schedule begins once we have received print-ready artwork.

                  Artwork can vary by printing method. Generally, we can accept
                  most types of professional graphics files. Best results will
                  be achieved from vector type files, also known as "draw"
                  files. These are produced by programs like Adobe® Illustrator®
                  (our preferred format), Corel Draw®, and Macromedia Freehand®
                  -- programs which generate "objects" or mathematically defined
                  shapes which can be filled and/or stroked with a specific spot
                  color. AutoCad®, or other CAD/CAM programs which can produce
                  files of type DXF or DWG can also be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Page layout programs combine pieces like vector files and
                  rasterized images into one layout. We can generally work with
                  Adobe® In-Design®, Adobe® PageMaker®, or Quark XPress®, and
                  Microsoft® Publisher®.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For certain jobs, we can also accept rasterized, or "paint"
                  type files. These are produced by programs such as Adobe®
                  Photoshop®, Corel Paint®, Painter®, etc. Paint files are known
                  as bitmapped files (actually a misnomer), because each pixel
                  of the image is mapped with a specific shade of color.
                  Rasterized images (like ones that come from a scanner), do not
                  translate as well to label production as do vector files,
                  particularly if they have to be "scaled" (adjusted in size).
                  Single color raster images will work best, and should be at
                  least 600 dpi resolution. That is, if you have a 3" x 4"
                  label, your raster file should be 1800 pixels by 2400 pixels.

                  provide easy to use upload tools in our quoters and/or at
                  checkout. While uploading label artwork is the easiest and
                  fastest way to get artwork to us, you can email or mail/ship
                  your artwork as well. If you do not upload your artwork, your
                  order will be held until your artwork is received. This means
                  that your turnaround time will begin when we receive your
                  artwork, not when you place your order. To have your
                  turnaround time begin when you pay for your order, use the
                  upload feature at checkout.

                  Some products can be designed online. In this case, the only
                  artwork you will probably need is your logo which can be
                  uploaded for use and placement in our design online tools.

                  uploaded once, so choose the most convenient option for you.
                  Once your artwork has been received, you will see your

                  Artwork can vary by printing method. Generally, we can accept
                  most types of professional graphics files. Best results will
                  be achieved from vector type files, also known as "draw"
                  files. These are produced by programs like Adobe® Illustrator®
                  (our preferred format), Corel Draw®, and Macromedia Freehand®
                  -- programs which generate "objects" or mathematically defined
                  shapes which can be filled and/or stroked with a specific spot
                  color. AutoCad®, or other CAD/CAM programs which can produce
                  files of type DXF or DWG can also be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Page layout programs combine pieces like vector files and
                  rasterized images into one layout. We can generally work with
                  Adobe® In-Design®, Adobe® PageMaker®, or Quark XPress®, and
                  Microsoft® Publisher®.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For certain jobs, we can also accept rasterized, or "paint"
                  type files. These are produced by programs such as Adobe®
                  Photoshop®, Corel Paint®, Painter®, etc. Paint files are known
                  as bitmapped files (actually a misnomer), because each pixel
                  of the image is mapped with a specific shade of color.
                  Rasterized images (like ones that come from a scanner), do not
                  translate as well to label production as do vector files,
                  particularly if they have to be "scaled" (adjusted in size).
                  Single color raster images will work best, and should be at
                  least 600 dpi resolution. That is, if you have a 3" x 4"
                  label, your raster file should be 1800 pixels by 2400 pixels.

                  Artwork can vary by printing method. Generally, we can accept
                  most types of professional graphics files. Best results will
                  be achieved from vector type files, also known as "draw"
                  files. These are produced by programs like Adobe® Illustrator®
                  (our preferred format), Corel Draw®, and Macromedia Freehand®
                  -- programs which generate "objects" or mathematically defined
                  shapes which can be filled and/or stroked with a specific spot
                  color. AutoCad®, or other CAD/CAM programs which can produce
                  files of type DXF or DWG can also be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Page layout programs combine pieces like vector files and
                  rasterized images into one layout. We can generally work with
                  Adobe® In-Design®, Adobe® PageMaker®, or Quark XPress®, and
                  Microsoft® Publisher®.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For certain jobs, we can also accept rasterized, or "paint"
                  type files. These are produced by programs such as Adobe®
                  Photoshop®, Corel Paint®, Painter®, etc. Paint files are known
                  as bitmapped files (actually a misnomer), because each pixel
                  of the image is mapped with a specific shade of color.
                  Rasterized images (like ones that come from a scanner), do not
                  translate as well to label production as do vector files,
                  particularly if they have to be "scaled" (adjusted in size).
                  Single color raster images will work best, and should be at
                  least 600 dpi resolution. That is, if you have a 3" x 4"

                  None. The online quote you receive includes all relevant
                  printing charges - we do not believe in “hidden charges”.
                  Note, however, that we review the artwork for every order we
                  produce. To make certain that you get the best representation
                  for your artwork, we might contact you if your artwork raises
                  any concerns with our production team.
