              <strong>1. Introduction.</strong>
              We are committed to respecting privacy and recognize the need for
              appropriate protection and management of any Personal Data that is
              shared with us as part of using our Site. As used in this Privacy
              Policy, "Personal Data" means any information that may be used,

              personally identify an individual.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2. Changes to this Privacy Policy.</strong>
              We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change the terms of
              this Privacy Policy at any time. You can see when this Privacy
              Policy was last updated by reviewing the “Last Updated” legend on

              changes to the Privacy Policy as appropriate under the

              PRIVACY POLICY WILL APPLY IMMEDIATELY UPON POSTING TO THE SITE..

              <strong>3. Information Collected.</strong>
              We may receive and/or collect Personal Data in the following ways:

              purposes, information security and abuse prevention, to track user
              trends, and to analyze the effectiveness of our Site. Alone or in
              combination with other information, such automatically collected
              information may constitute Personal Data. Some of our service
              providers (described in Section 5, below) may use cookies or other
              methods to gather information regarding your use of our Site. Such
              third parties may use these cookies or other tracking methods for
              their own purposes by relating information about your use of our
              Site with any Personal Data about you that they may have. The use
              of such information by a third party depends on the privacy policy
              of that third party.

                7.2. <a href="#">Opting-Out of Promotional Emails.</a> You may
                choose not to receive future promotional or advertising emails
                from us by selecting an unsubscribe link at the bottom of each
                email that you receive from us, or by responding to the emails

                <strong> 8. Data Security. </strong><br />
                The security of Personal Data is important to us. We follow
                generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal
                Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
                receive it. However, no method of transmission over the
                Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
                Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means
                to protect Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute
                security.
              </p>

                Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Data from
                anyone we know to be under 18 years of age.
